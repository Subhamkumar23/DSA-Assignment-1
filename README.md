# DSA-Assignment-1

In this assignment I have implemented an idea in which multiple doubly linkedlist can reside inside an array. All the nodes that are not assigned currently are included in a free list.
Insertion,deletion,creation of new list, count number of nodes etc operations are supported.
Also there is an operation called defragmentation in which all the nodes that are currently assigned are continuously located and all the free nodes are also contiously placed.

```
#include <stdio.h>

return 0;
```
